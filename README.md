## Who Am I

Yiqin Zhang. Currently focusing on **1)** medical imaging and analysis and **2)** electrophysiology data system design. I am interested in various deep-learning-based method.

My most esteemed project is [mgamdata](https://github.com/MGAMZ/mgam_datatoolkit), a collection of the vast majority of my work, which is continually evolving and being updated.
