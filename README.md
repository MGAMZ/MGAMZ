## Who Am I

Yiqin Zhang. Currently focusing on **1)** medical imaging and analysis and **2)** electrophysiology data system design. I'm also interested in various deep-learning-based method.

My most esteemed project is [mgam-ITKIT](https://github.com/MGAMZ/ITKIT), a collection of the vast majority of my work, which is continually evolving and updated.
